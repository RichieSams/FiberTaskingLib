= Contributing

Any contributions to this library are highly welcome. I created this library as a learning experience, both for myself, and for future users. That said, when contributing to this repository, please first create an issue on Github before making a change. I may have thought about the issues before and can contribute thoughts, or prior research. Lastly, the issue serves as a way to track community requests and progress.

Please note that the project has a code of conduct; please follow it in all your interactions with the project. See below for the full details.

## Code Formatting Conventions

The project has a code style. See the https://github.com/RichieSams/FiberTaskingLib/blob/master/documentation/code_style.asciidoc[code style page] for details.

## Git Commit Formatting

Commit messages must follow the https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary[conventional commits] format. This allows us to automatically generate semantic-versioning and changelogs. In addition, the commit message information should roughly follow the style below. Chris Beams wrote an http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/[excellent blog post] detailing this style. I highly suggest reading it.

[source,txt]
----
<type>[optional scope]: Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. In some contexts, 
the first line is treated as the subject of the commit and the rest of
the text as the body. The blank line separating the summary from the body
is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`,
`shortlog` and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 * Bullet points are okay, too

 * Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Attribution
